## Project Description

A scheduling program that uses simulated annealing algorithm, with 3 workstations and a number of workspaces inside each workstations.

## Running the program

**(For windows)**

Before running the program, install all the requirements by using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


In the root folder, use the following command:

```
./run.bat
```

this will automatically change directory to src and run the SA.py script

After running the script, input the variables according to the data

Alternatively, after running the script, copy the text files in the test directory and use `CTRL + SHIFT + V` to paste it to the terminal for inputs
